# Day 9: Data Lakehouse and Cloud Data Warehouse

Today is a sort of departure from the other two days with dbt Fundamentals course ([Day 7](007.md) and [Day 8](008.md)). It's a reading day!

I'm kind of surprised to learn that **Data Lakehouse** and **Cloud Data Warehouse** are not really the same concepts!

The key takeaway of [Don‚Äôt Let a Cloud Data Warehouse Bottleneck your Machine Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dont-let-cloud-data-warehouse-bottleneck-your-machine-jason-pohl/) article by Jason Pohl is:

> Cloud data warehouses were not designed to perform machine learning [...] as slow, expensive, and require multiple governance layers

1. Cloud data warehouses (CDW) export a large amount of data directly to cloud object storage (trying to mitigate the bottleneck accessing large datasets, e.g. while training a ML model)
    * leverage many nodes of a CDW to copy data in parallel from its proprietary internal format to an open format, like Apache Parquet, onto cloud storage
    * data can then be ingested in parallel to perform model training
1. A data lakehouse stores data once and directly on cloud storage in an open format
    * then ingests directly from there to perform model training
    * the data is written once and can be read many times without the need to copy it.

There's more but I didn't mean to copy the whole article (and claim it's mine üòè).
